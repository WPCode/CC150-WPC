		You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play 1 of 2 games.
		Game #1: You get one shot to make the hoop.
		Game #2: You get three shots and you have to make 2 of 3 shots.
		If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should you pick
		one game or the other?


		Assume make it is 0.5:
			#1: 0.5
			#2: 0.5*0.5*0.5*3 + 0.5*0.5*0.5= 0.5
			
		Assume make one is p:
			#1: p
			#2: p*p*p + 3*p*p*(1-p)
